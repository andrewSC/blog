Hi all,

So over the past month or so I’ve been having some pretty xtreme issues with my 2011 Apple Macbook Air 13” and to put it lightly, they could have been a real deal breaker if I hadn’t backed my data up. Basically it started with my laptop intermittently freezing. Now these freezes weren’t the easiest kind to diagnose because their timings were inconsistent/I couldn’t trigger the lockup through a series of repeatable actions. Basically  the only way out of these things was to do a hard reset (I tried waiting out the pinwheel of death, iLost). Finally, after about three months of inconsistent lockups the SSD progressed to complete NAND/SSD controller failure.

Because I’m the genius that I am, I had everything backed up to a TimeMachine on my RAID 1 NAS so I didn’t lose any data but it did bring my productivity to a grinding halt for the rest of the day. I ended up spending the next six or so hours waiting for TimeMachine to restore the latest backup to the original SSD. Once that was done, I had my wheels back. OR SO I THOUGHT *dun dun dun*

About a week later I started having some very odd trackpad issues (f*** me, right?). The trackpad would emote from time to time and click-n-drag all the things or assume I was dragging my knuckles all over it in an attempt to click the proper tab on my web browser. Well, it got to the point where I had had enough and decided to take destiny by the reins (whoa)

First, I placed an order with [iFixit](http://bit.ly/Riv5u0)

Second, I printed [this](http://bit.ly/RiAGRb) guide.

Third, I disassembled my laptop:

Voilà! and that completes my trackpad superfuntime.gif replacement experience.  Honestly I was expecting it to be much worse given the recent reviews about how Macbooks are becoming incredibly difficult to repair. However, compared to my Acer Ferrari 4000, this was painless.
