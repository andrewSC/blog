Over the past couple of months I've been working on a side project to design a landing-type page which I finally
finished about two weekends ago. Looking back, I now realize finding inspiration was a lot harder than I expected so
I've decided to share some resources I found most helpful. But before I do, I wanted to talk about the design process I
went through. My first effort which took several weekends resulted in this:

Initially I was really into the idea of a darker themed website as every dark website I'd ever seen had a nice look to it.
However, as time went on I started to realize that picking the right color palette as well as the general criticalness that
is a dark background can become a real difficult problem if you don't know exactly what you want the end product to look like.
I also felt it was lacking a somewhat professional touch and the fact that I still had two other full sections to design
lead me to a redesign of the entire thing. The picture below is what I ended up with on a Saturday night after scrapping 
the entire project a day before.

Basically I had three major things I wanted to be prominent at first glance: content, ease-of-use, and elegance. With my
initial design I missed the content part entirely so that became my focus in the resdesign. Other focuses of mine were to
maintain responsiveness as well as really focus on interation rather than trying to perfect it the first time around.
Anyways, here are some of the links I used for inspiration:

These sites are basically showcase sites that other designers have submitted. I also found
[http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design](http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design) and its subreddits to be pretty useful as well.
